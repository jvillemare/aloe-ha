# Plant Data Sources

We obtained plant data from the following four sources:

 - [The University of Delaware: Water Resource Center's Flora of Delaware Online Database](http://www.wrc.udel.edu/de-flora/)
 - [The Chesapeake Bay Native Plant Center](http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/plants/)
 - [The USDA's Natural Resource Conservation Service](https://plants.sc.egov.usda.gov/java/characteristics)
 - A Microsoft Word table provided by a client from a local farming community in Arden, Newark.

[The scripts used to process the data sources into JSONs can be found here](../scripts).

[The processed JSON files can be found here](../GardenProject/src/main/resources/plantData/).

From the data sources combined, and eliminating duplicates, we have
over 4,000 plants.
