# Storyboard

Our old storyboard is invalid because our ideas were not explicitly approved by
our professor and the client. We must redo the storyboard, and have it hand
drawn.

9 to 12 frames. Get across the flow of an app's windows to a person (client)
that's evaluating our ideas. Storyboards are hand drawn (as clients will seize
on the details and miss the ideas.) Don't make it drawn too well (as client
will think it's final.)
