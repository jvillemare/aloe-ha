Objective: GUI software to allow the user to create and view garden designs using native plants.

- User can identify plant characteristics to narrow plant selection, e.g. light, water, bloom time, food, bloom color, soil reqs

- User is given a menu of plants from which to drag onto the garden area (top view)

- Plants have bloom, non-bloom, and winter images (these may be shaded ovals/circles); images must appear correctly sized relative to the garden and other plants. User can view garden at different times and images will change.

- Land surrounding garden can be labeled (e.g. woods, lawn)


Some special features that client liked:

    ability to "relax" plant characteristics to see more plants
    hover to see plant characteristics
    "window" view from side; requires a separate set of plant images
    0, 1, 2 years size
    irregular shaped gardens allowed (e.g. upload a line drawing)
    garden characteristics can be entered for parts of garden and used to narrow plant selection
    ability to place special features (rock, path, tree, etc)
    auto rate the garden on:
    	number of animals fed
    	continuous bloom
    	happiness: degree to which plant characteristics match garden
    	transition: degree to which garden transitions well into adjacent
    "save" multiple versions of the garden

Other special features:

      Each team can add special features that they think will be enjoyed by the client. Note that these features should appear in the storyboard so that client can give feedback.
