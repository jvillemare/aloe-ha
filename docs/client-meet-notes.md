Background: Arden (town, direct democracy, clustered housing, 50 acres of protected forest surrounds.) --> Libertarian, rustic, hand-crafted.

 - Surrounded by I-95 & housing developments
  - Barren, grass lawns
  - What was lost because of these developments?
    - Insects (reduced habitat)
	- Birds (don't have insects to eat or trees to live in)
	- **The Green Desert** (*read Doug Tallamy*)

Sustainable landscape definition: Stable and productive ecosyustem that can be conserved, even w/ humans living there.

 - Arden: 80% tree canopy (cover)
 - Newark: ~36% tree canopy

Runoff storm-water from neighboring townships created "incised" water channels that erode the ecosystem.
 - Solution: Buffer creek and redirect storm-runoff.
 - AKA Riparian Buffer: Does N2O and other nutrient reduction; used between suburban and forest areas. Used around Arden.

What they need for sustainable ecosystems?
 - Responsible land use
 - Protection of forest fragments (and protect forest succession)

**Software for** individual homeowners to learn how to better integrate their land with the neighboring land to make a continuous canopy and forest stage developments.
 - Recipe for layers of plants to better protect forest edges.
 - Compress forest succession into a few feet, something attractive.
 - How to keep forest ecosystem healthy?
  - Replace invasive species w/ native plants to fill niches (vacuums don't persist in nature)
  - **Know your site:** How much **moisture**, **light**, nearby plants, soil quality? Additionally: Aesthetics (color, fragrance, height), **bloom time** (keep it always blooming for pollinator), **food sources** (berries/seeds?) and many other factors.

### Question and Answers from Client

 - How much information do we have from the user?
  - Top-down plot, or out-a-window view, for a few generic versions or for the specific home address.
 - How much user background?
  - Can't expect anything, some education from app needed.
 - Specific elements?
  - Sun, light, how much it serves the habitat. Native plants, bloom time, etc.
 - Giving a homeowner options versus serving the community at large?
  - Working to stop forest edges, or if they're standalone, identify their own plot manually.
 - Client Budget?
  - Maybe not.
 - Perspective?
  - Street-view and/or top-down.
 - Timeline of Plant Maturation?
  - Yes
 - Restrictions?
  - Just native plants as they're usually low/no maintenance.
 - Invasive Plant Awareness?
  - Yes
 - User Input?
  - Hand-hold for basic plot info (sunshine, wetness, dimensions, etc.)
 - Plant Compatibility?
  - Yes, Mt. Cuba plant database as a reference.
 - Guide versus Tool?
  - Specific instructions (plant X at Y because Z reason.)
 - Interactive?
  - Multiple types of input for those that are unaware of their plot attributes.
  - Low-maintenance/barrier user question form; No digging soil.
 - Design Software vs Provide Options?
  - Design software that suggests the recommended plot and provides options from that.
 - Tree Maturation Selection?
  - Slider b/w cheaper younger, shorter saplings or expensive older, taller trees.
 - Empty Plot?
  - Allow placement of existing plants.
