Thank you! no longer forbidden.

r.e. Ideas: You are ahead of the class! I'm planning to ask for ideas
*before* the end of Spring Break, bc otherwise we won't have much time. So
teams will be asked for input.

Note that casual design, like storyboards, is best done with simple line
drawings, basic colors. Nothing pretty or complicated. The reason is that
clients who see ANYTHING that looks like the product will start to focus on
unimportant details instead of overall design. We don't want them thinking
about where the buttons live, the color scheme, fgs font, etc.

The project will probably end up being a cross between your versions 1 and
3. Plant placement should be free, not a grid. Plants will have different
sizes.

Note: we do not need 3D models to show a front view, just a different pic.
We aren't rotating.
