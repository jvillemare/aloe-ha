# How to Setup this Repo with Eclipse

1. For convenience, `cd` into your current Eclipse workspace (by default, it's in your home user directory).
2. Once inside your current Eclipse workspace, run `git clone https://github.com/jvillemare/cisc275-011-team-0.git`
3. In Eclipse, click `File > Switch Workspace > Other...`, and select the folder `cisc275-011-team-0`
4. In Eclipse, click `File > Open Projects From Filesystem...`, then click the `Directory` button, and once again select the same `cisc275-011-team-0` folder.
5. **Uncheck** the `cisc275-011-team-0` folder in the table, and **check** the `cisc275-011-team-0\GardenProject` folder in the table.
6. Select the Finish button in the same window.
7. If successful, you should see the `GardenProject` folder in your Package Explorer on the left in Eclipse.
