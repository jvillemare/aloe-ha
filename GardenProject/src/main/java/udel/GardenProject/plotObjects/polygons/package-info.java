/**
 * Polygons can have an arbitrary number of points, have points that are 
 * editable, points that move with the polygon as the polygon is dragged, and
 * other critical polygon features.<br><br>
 * 
 * All classes in this package should extend the <code>GenericPolygon</code>
 * abstract class and give it an AdjustablePolygon, specifying its color, anchor
 * color, and more.
